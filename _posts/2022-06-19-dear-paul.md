Dear Paul,

Doth my RSS reader deceive me?

As Iâ€™ve been away from Twitter and have only encountered this link via my RSS application, Iâ€™ve taken it upon myself to contact [{% indieAvatar "https://feedbin.com" %}Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) support to correct what must be an error in their typically inerrant feed reading application experience.

I have not yet clicked through to your web blog out of concern for my own cybersecurity. I suspect that I am being targeted for an elaborate phishing attack. No one will be jacking my clicks, I can assure you of that.

If not a nation-state level cyber-attack: might this be yet another instance of a [Richard Revolution video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) trolling?

Or perhaps youâ€™ve simply let your domain name renewal lapse. Has the technology behind domain parking pages advanced to a never before seen level of individualized personalization? Is this a marketing ploy by GoDaddy on this the most sacred of company holidays: GoFatherâ€™s Day?

Please contact me through the usual second-factor back-channels to ensure that everything isâ€”as [GitHub status tweets casually and confidently repeat](https://twitter.com/githubstatus/status/1537677946030260226)â€”operating normally.

Until then Iâ€™m afraid the link will remain unapologetically and skeptically `:not(:visited)`.

Kind domain shards,
Zach
