I was on GitHub’s Open Source Friday to chat a bit about WebC and Eleventy.

I believe the full video will be posted [to GitHub’s Open Source Friday playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFmtstItnKlhJJVmMghxc0P) at some point in the future, and when that happens I’ll circle back and post it here.
