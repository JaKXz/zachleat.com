title: "The Next Phase of Eleventy: Return of the Side Project"
tags: eleventy
---
As Eleventy continues forward on its mission to help super-fans of HTML quickly and easily build things for the web, as a responsible steward of the project I must disclose that we are no longer doing so with full time sponsorship. As such, Eleventy will be returning to its roots as a side-project and transitioning away from full time development.

Up front, I do want to make a few things clear:

1. No action is required by folks building with Eleventy. Eleventy has always been independently bootstrapped and it is not changing ownership/stewardship. We march on independently as before.
1. We are _thankful_ for the [year](/web/eleventy-oss/) of full time development and maintenance donated to the project by Netlify and I’m proud of the things we shipped in that time: including but not limited to the stable [2.0 release](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2/).

It’s incredible to recognize that we’re nearing _6 million lifetime downloads_ on npm and almost [60,000 repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy). I’m so appreciative of the community of folks that have propelled this little open source project to where it is today.

Eleventy will continue forward in a reduced (and more focused) capacity. We’ll have to make some tough prioritization decisions which may include deprecation (or community-ownership?) of some of our official plugins (as always obeying semantic versioning principles). **You can help inform these decisions by taking the [Eleventy Community Survey (2023)](https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8).**

We’ll make these decisions responsibly with the data we collect from the survey but to give a small clue as to the potential severity of the cuts the Vite, Serverless, and Edge plugins all come to mind as eligible targets right now. Eleventy has always been a build-first tool and refocusing Eleventy’s core feature set to bundler-free static site generation will allow us to continue to serve folks that have come to rely on the project.

Realistically it must be acknowledged that this news is a bit of a setback for Eleventy—but importantly I am still personally very passionate about the project’s continued survival. From the very beginning I had an expectation that Eleventy was a ten-year project and we’re on year six of that timeline.

## How can you help?

First off, please take one or two minutes to fill out [Eleventy’s Community Survey](https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8) to help shape the future of the project (it’s a few multiple choice questions).

**If your company has a vested interest in Eleventy would like to see Eleventy continue with full time development and maintenance, please [get in touch](mailto:zach@zachleat.com).**

If you have any comments or questions about this announcement, don’t hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:zach@zachleat.com).

…and keep building for the web! ❤️
