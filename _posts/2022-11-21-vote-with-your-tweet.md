title: Vote With Your Tweet

Twitter is backsliding into irrelevance. It has been a whirlwind three weeks of bad managerial decisions over there, including:

* _October 28, 2022:_ El\*n M\*sk finishes a (forced?) hostile-takeover acquisition of Twitter.
* _November 3, 2022:_ Twitter lays off ~3,700 of 7,500 employees, including folks on the Human Rights team ([_Source_](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/twitter-layoffs)), the Trust and Safety team, the Accessibility team, and more.
* _November 12, 2022:_ Laying off 5,000 contractors ([_Source_](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/musk-recruits-engineers-for-twitter-2-0-after-mass-layoffs-and-resignations/))
* Unilaterally banning remote work and destroying any previously established work-life balance norms.
* Shipping and pausing an $8 blue check program that began a series of very embarrassing high-profile Impersonator ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù accounts (including a lot of fake-brands, which I‚Äôm sure advertisers loved).
* _November 14, 2022:_ Firing an employee for disagreeing with him on Twitter. ([_Source_](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-appears-fire-software-engineer-argued-twitter-rcna57170))
* _November 17, 2022:_ M\*sk‚Äôs ‚Äúhardcore¬†ultimatum‚Äù fired approximately 1000 more ([_Source_](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/21/23472025/elon-musk-twitter-hiring-again-ending-layoffs))
* _November 19, 2022:_ Reinstatment of D\*nald Tr\*mp‚Äôs twitter account ([_Source_](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/elon-musk-donald-trump-twitter/672195/)), which he had promised to do in May of this year ([_Source_](https://www.npr.org/2022/05/10/1097942860/elon-musk-reverse-donald-trump-twitter-ban)).

That last one was the last straw for many folks. In time we should probably analyze _why_ this was the last straw and not some of the other previously very terrible things, but in the mean time (and more productively) we can use that momentum to organize!

On the same night as the controversial reinstatement, I shipped a microsite for folks to organize and take action in response:

## [votewithyourtweet.com](https://votewithyourtweet.com/)

<a href="https://votewithyourtweet.com/"><img src="/web/img/posts/votewithyourtweet/screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of votewithyourtweet.com"></a>

In the first two days of the campaign, 184 folks have participated in the hash tag‚Äîwow!

If you want to participate as well, please do! [Head on over](https://votewithyourtweet.com/) and take the pledge.

The site has received 12,173 pageviews so far from 4,865 visitors (using a comically cumulative total of 32 MB of hosting bandwidth üëÄ).

## My future on Twitter

I‚Äôve taken a number of steps to reduce my Twitter footprint, both professionally and personally.

1. I removed the Twitter bio link from zachleat.com.
1. I removed the Twitter bio link from [11ty.dev](https://www.11ty.dev/).
1. I‚Äôm hosting archives for both [my tweets](/twitter/) and the [Eleventy tweets](https://twitter.11ty.dev). (you can [do this too using `tweetback`](https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback)‚Äîwhich I have short-term plans to blog about as well)
1. I put my [personal account in protected mode](https://fediverse.zachleat.com/@zachleat/109383850016014385) to reduce Twitter‚Äôs ability to monetize pageviews from my content. ([Inspired by Kevin Beaumont](https://infosec.exchange/@gossithedog/109383383214225357))
1. I put up _‚ÄúThis account is now dormant‚Äù_ [warning tweets on the `@eleven_ty`](https://twitter.11ty.dev/1594772925332201473/) and `@webc_omponents` accounts.

I think these steps are sufficient for now. I don‚Äôt have a plan to bulk delete any tweets.

If Twitter takes substantiative and measurable steps to improve, I may scale back some of these‚Äîbut given current trends this seems unlikely.
