A lightweight structural-only zero-dependency web component wrapper for `<table>` to render wide tables in small viewports. Automatically creates a two-column layout at small screens with table headers repeated throughout.

Works with Container Queries or Media Queries. Easily customize the ratio of the two-column layout in markup.

Heavily inspired by [Filament Groupâ€™s Tablesaw Stack jQuery plugin](https://github.com/filamentgroup/tablesaw) (I also worked on that project).
